This is Marc's game that is being built in Roblox Studio using the Lua programming language.

It's a bit large, as Roblox Studio games are designed to stay in the studio app, however once you open the file you can click "view raw" and that will bring up the code being used for his project.

There's a lot of binaries being used which may not look like much, but when the project is opened in studio those get compiled into more readable code that he works with.
